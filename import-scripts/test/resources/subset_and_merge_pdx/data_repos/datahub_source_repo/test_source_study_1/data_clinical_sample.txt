#Identifier to uniquely specify a patient.	A unique sample identifier.	Age (in years) at which sequencing was reported	Passage Number	The assigned Oncotree code of the sample as defined by the Oncotree cancer classification system for precision oncology.	Stage At Diagnosis	T Stage	Numeric value to express the degree of abnormality of cancer cells, a measure of differentiation and aggressiveness.	The type assigned to a sample (i.e., normal, primary, met, recurrence).	The organ sub-division term assigned to the primary tumor location of the sample.	The sample classification (i.e., tumor, cellline, xenograph).	Treated	The gene panel or assay used used to perform targeted NGS on the sample.	The method used for preparing the tissue for examination and study.	Tissue Site	Metastatic tumor location (anatomic location to which the cancer has spread).	Sign-out comments from pathologist or fellow.	Sequencing coverage	Proportion of cancer cells in tumor sample.	MSI interpretation.	Microsatellite Instability (MSI) score.	Directly related to MSI Score; Possible values include Stable, Instable, Indeterminate, or Do not report.	Institute Source	Indicates if there exists a matched normal used for tumor sample analysis.	Whether or not a supplemental MSK-ARCHER test was performed on the sample in addition to the MSK-IMPACT test.	Procedure Type
